Edit baseDir in compile_main.sh to point to the base folder of the git repo (laph_build_and_run) 

To run the baryon observables code, make sure installation suceeded according to the master branch of the project.

Then modify compile_main.sh to point to your installation directories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that
{Lx, Ly, Lz, Nt and Nvec} are defined in the input.in textfile. 
{Nvec_snk, Nvec_src} are for the number of vector cutoff for perambulators.
For ex, if Nvec_snk < Nvec, the sink eigenvectors larger than Nvec_snk are ignored and becomes zeros, 
but there's no gain in the number of floating point calculations. 

See run_test_Lx4Lt8/input_singlesource_Nvec4.in as an example

------------------------------------------------------
To compile, 
sh compile_main.sh Nc correlation_basis_string
ex) compile_main.sh 4 T2gSz2_0_x_EgSz2_0 will generate the executable ./main_Nc4_T2gSz2_0_x_EgSz2_0_gpu.exe
./main_Nc4_T2gSz2_0_x_EgSz2_0_gpu.exe input.in > output.txt 2>&1
